2. 3 Tools and Technologies Used
For the Sharekatcom application, we will use the following tools and technologies. Mobile application:
1. Flutter: is an open-source mobile application development framework created by Google. It allows developers to build high-quality, natively compiled mobile applications for both Android and iOS platforms with a single codebase. Flutter uses the Dart programming language and offers a modern reactive programming model, a flexible UI toolkit, and extensive support for various third-party packages and plugins for advanced functionalities. With its hot reload feature and easy-to-use development tools, Flutter has gained popularity among developers for its faster development process and excellent performance.
2. Firebase: is a mobile and web application development platform that provides a set of tools and services such as databases, authentication, hosting, and storage. We will be using Firebase to handle the backend of the application, including user authentication, data storage, and real-time updates. 
3. Android Studio: is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing Android apps. It provides a set of tools and features that make it easy to develop, test, and deploy Android applications. We will be using Android Studio to develop the mobile application. 
4. GitHub: is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It allows for easy collaboration, code review, and issue tracking. We will be using GitHub to host and share the source code for this project. These tools and technologies have been chosen for their reliability, scalability, and ease of use. They have a well-established track record in the industry.
